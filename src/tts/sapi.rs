//! SAPI 5 engine: voice enumeration and synthesis into the mixer.
//!
//! Speech runs on a dedicated COM (STA) thread owning the SAPI voices;
//! requests arrive over a channel so callers never block. Every request is
//! synthesized to memory at the mixer format (48 kHz stereo 16-bit) and
//! trickle-fed into the named source's ring in the audio engine.
//!
//! SAPI used to also speak each message through an `ISpVoice` of its own, out
//! of the default playback device and around the mixer entirely, because it was
//! the only engine that *could*. That made it the only engine the broadcaster
//! could hear without monitoring its strip, and it meant the source's fader and
//! mute governed what listeners heard but not what the broadcaster did. All nine
//! engines now take the same route: the strip is heard locally on its own (see
//! `SourceSpec::local` in [`crate::audio`]), so a second voice here would simply
//! be the same words twice.
