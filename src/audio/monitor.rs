//! The monitoring output thread: plays whatever the mixer taps for monitoring
//! out of the playback device chosen in Preferences (the system default until
//! the user picks one) — see [`crate::audio::render::output_render_device`],
//! which owns that setting and is also what local sound cues open. A change
//! reaches this thread by way of `EngineCommand::ReopenMonitor`, which drops
//! the thread so `engine_loop`'s per-block check spawns a fresh one.
//!
//! This is the mirror image of [`crate::audio::capture`] — same supervisor
//! shape, same backoff, same cooperative stop flag — but running a WASAPI
//! *render* client instead of a capture one. It is the only place Pubsplash
//! opens an output device, and it is only opened while at least one mixer strip
//! is being monitored.
//!
//! The engine and the device are on independent clocks: the mixer is paced by
//! `sleep` on a 10 ms grid, the render client by WASAPI's event. The ring
//! buffer between them absorbs that difference. The engine drops samples when
//! the ring is full and this thread writes silence when it runs dry — neither
//! side ever blocks the other.
