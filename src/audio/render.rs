//! Playing a buffer of engine-format samples out of Pubsplash's chosen render
//! device, with nothing else attached.
//!
//! This is the bottom half of `cue.rs`, split out for the same reason
//! `convert.rs` was: the standalone Sound Pack Manager has to preview the file
//! an author just picked, and its preview used to be a PowerShell
//! `System.Media.SoundPlayer` shell-out, which plays WAV and nothing else — no
//! use at all once a pack may hold Opus. So this file is `#[path]`-included
//! there, and like `convert.rs` it must name nothing from this crate: no
//! `crate::`, no `super::`. That is why the two constants below are spelled out
//! rather than imported from `convert`, and why the device is opened here
//! instead of through `audio::device`.
//!
//! That isolation is also why the *output device setting* lives here rather
//! than in `audio::device`, where it would otherwise belong: Pubsplash plays
//! out of exactly one endpoint through two independent paths — the mixer's
//! monitoring tap (`audio::monitor`) and the local cues below — and only one of
//! those two files may name the crate. So this one owns
//! [`OUTPUT_DEVICE`] and [`output_render_device`], and `audio::device` and
//! `audio::monitor` reach *in* here, never the reverse. The standalone binaries
//! never call [`set_output_device`], so they keep following the system default.
