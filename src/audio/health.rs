//! Capture health accounting: what each source's ring is doing, and what the
//! device told us on the way in.
//!
//! This exists because the whole source→mixer path used to be silent. A source
//! whose ring filled up discarded samples in [`super::capture::push_f32`]
//! without a word, a starved ring was zero-padded in [`super::mixer::pull_block`]
//! without a word, and the `BufferInfo` WASAPI hands back from every read — which
//! carries the OS's own "I dropped your audio" flag — was thrown away unread. So
//! when a user reported their microphone crackling half an hour into a stream,
//! there was nothing in their log to look at, and no way to tell the difference
//! between the three things it could have been.
//!
//! The three, and how one line separates them:
//!
//! - **The ring ratcheting up.** The engine mixes on a wall clock and pads
//!   whatever has not arrived; padding inserts samples without consuming any, so
//!   a late packet adds latency that never drains. `ring` climbing across a
//!   session toward the one-second capacity, then flattening as `samples dropped`
//!   starts moving, is this one.
//! - **The OS losing packets.** `discontinuities` and `gap frames` are Windows
//!   telling on itself; if they move, the audio was gone before we saw it.
//! - **The device clock being off.** `device N Hz (M ppm)` is measured against
//!   the monotonic clock, not asserted from the format we asked for.
//!
//! Nothing in here is on the mixing hot path except integer counter arithmetic.
//! The formatting happens once every thirty seconds, from the engine loop, which
//! already logs and allocates on that thread.
// Items below are reached only from the Windows `imp` in this file (or from the
// subsystem it belongs to). They are not dead in the codebase, only unreached
// while the macOS side of this seam is unbuilt, and each will be wanted again
// the moment it is -- so this is scoped to the file rather than being a
// crate-wide allow, and comes off with the last stub here.
