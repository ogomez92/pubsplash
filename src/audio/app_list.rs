//! The list of applications a user can pick as an Application source.
//!
//! Typing an executable name from memory is the one thing a screen-reader user
//! cannot verify, so the picker offers the running apps instead. "Running" is
//! deliberately narrower than "in the process table": what matters is whether
//! the OS has ever seen the process open an audio stream, which is exactly what
//! the WASAPI session list records — sessions stay enumerable while they are
//! `Inactive` or `Expired`, so an app that played a sound a minute ago is still
//! offered. Everything else the user might want (an app that has not made a
//! sound yet) is reachable through the wider view, keyed off having a visible
//! window, and anything still missing can be typed by hand.
//!
//! The platform seam is those two questions and nothing else: which pids have
//! made a sound, and which pids own a window. [`candidates`] — the filtering,
//! the system-process exclusion, the dedupe and the sort — takes them as plain
//! pid sets and is portable, which is also why it is the part that has tests.
