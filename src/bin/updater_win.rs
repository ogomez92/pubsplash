//! The Windows half of `pubsplash-update`: applies an update once Pubsplash
//! itself has exited. Reached through `bin/updater.rs`, which is the platform
//! seam; see its header for why this is a file of its own.
//!
//! Windows will not let a running executable be replaced, and the NSIS installer
//! wants Pubsplash gone before it writes — so neither half of an update can be
//! done by the process being updated. This is that second process.
//!
//! **It is always run from a copy in the data directory's `update\runner\`,
//! never from the install directory itself.** Two things depend on that. A
//! portable update replaces the files at the top of the install directory,
//! which would include this binary if it were running from there — a portable
//! copy's data directory is a *subfolder* of the install, which `apply_portable`
//! never touches. And the installer must not be a child of a process that is
//! about to exit. Nothing here deletes the copy — a process
//! cannot unmap its own image — so Pubsplash clears the whole work directory at
//! its next start (`update::cleanup_leftovers`).
//!
//! Usage:
//!
//! ```text
//! pubsplash-update --wait-pid <pid> --run-installer <setup.exe>
//! pubsplash-update --wait-pid <pid> --apply <staging> --target <dir> --relaunch <exe>
//! ```
//!
//! Everything it is handed has already been downloaded, size-checked and
//! SHA-256-verified by Pubsplash, and a portable update has already been
//! extracted and confirmed to contain `pubsplash.exe`. This binary deliberately
//! knows nothing about HTTP, JSON or archives: by the time it runs there is no
//! user interface left to report a subtle failure to, so its only job is the one
//! step that cannot be done earlier.
//!
//! Failure is not silent. A portable update that cannot be completed is rolled
//! back from the move-aside directory and reported with a message box — the user
//! has just watched their app close, and an app that never comes back with no
//! explanation is the worst outcome available.
