//! UI localization: one embedded gettext catalog per language, looked up by the
//! English source text.
//!
//! Three deliberate choices, because each of them is load-bearing and the
//! obvious alternative is worse for *this* app:
//!
//! 1. **The msgid is the English string itself, not an invented key.** Pubsplash
//!    is used almost entirely by screen-reader users, and a partially translated
//!    build is the normal state of affairs for a long time after a language is
//!    added. With English as the key, a string nobody has translated yet reads
//!    out as correct English; with invented keys, it reads out as
//!    `prefs-audio-output-device`, which is worse than not translating at all.
//!    Every `t!` therefore degrades to its own argument, and that is a property
//!    of the design rather than a fallback path someone has to remember to add.
//!
//! 2. **The catalog is a `.po` parsed here, not a `.mo` loaded by wxWidgets.**
//!    wxdragon does expose the whole `wxTranslations` API, and using it was the
//!    first plan, but it wants compiled `.mo` files on disk under
//!    `locale/<lang>/LC_MESSAGES/`. That means a build step (`msgfmt`, which is
//!    not on a stock Windows box), files to add to the packager's resource list,
//!    and two install layouts to get right — see `data_dir` — for a feature
//!    whose failure mode is a silently English UI. Embedding the `.po` with
//!    `include_str!` and parsing it once costs a few milliseconds at startup,
//!    ships nothing, and behaves identically in a portable copy and an
//!    installed one. It also lets us support `msgctxt`, which `wxTranslations`
//!    does not expose and which [`translate_ctx`] needs. Note that the vendored
//!    wxWidgets ships no message catalogs of its own either, so
//!    `add_std_catalog()` would have found nothing to load.
//!
//! 3. **Log lines are never translated.** Users are asked to send their log when
//!    something goes wrong, and a log in a language the maintainer cannot read
//!    is not a diagnostic. Nothing inside a `log::` macro goes through `t!`.
//!    The same goes for the identity names in `SourceConfig.name`, which route
//!    external feeds and speech requests — see `source_name`, which is where the
//!    *displayed* form of a source is built and where translation belongs.
//!
//! The catalog is written once during [`init`] and only read afterwards, so
//! [`t!`] is callable from any thread — the TTS workers and the media player
//! reach it as readily as the UI thread does.
//!
//! Adding a language is a `.po` file under `po/`, a row in [`LANGUAGES`], and a
//! line in [`CATALOGS`]. `cargo run --bin gen-po` refreshes every `.po` from the
//! source and from `help.toml` without disturbing existing translations.
