//! HTTP plumbing for the updater: a client, the GitHub URLs, and a hashed,
//! cancellable download.
//!
//! A client of its own rather than `tts::net::client`, for one reason that
//! matters: that one sets a client-wide `.timeout(30s)`, which in reqwest covers
//! the *whole* request including the streamed body. A ten-megabyte installer on
//! a slow line would be guillotined mid-download and look like a network fault.
//! Only the connect phase is bounded here; a download that is making progress is
//! allowed to take as long as it takes, and the user's Cancel button is what
//! stops one that is not.
//!
//! Redirects are left at reqwest's default of "follow", unlike
//! `AudioPubClient`'s `Policy::none()`: `releases/latest/download/<name>` is a
//! 302 to `objects.githubusercontent.com`, so refusing to follow it would break
//! every download.
