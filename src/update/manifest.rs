//! `latest.json` — the release description Pubsplash reads to decide whether an
//! update exists.
//!
//! Published as a release asset by the workflow rather than read from the GitHub
//! API, for two reasons. `api.github.com` is rate-limited to 60 requests an hour
//! per *IP*, which a shared or NAT'd network burns through without the user
//! doing anything wrong, and it 403s a request with no `User-Agent`. The asset
//! download endpoint has neither problem. It also lets the schema carry the one
//! thing the API does not: a SHA-256 per artifact, so a truncated or mangled
//! download is caught before anything is run.
//!
//! Schema changes must stay additive. Serde ignores unknown fields by default,
//! which is deliberate here: a future release that adds a key must still be
//! readable by today's build, or the users who most need to update are exactly
//! the ones who cannot see it.
