#![allow(dead_code)]
//! Where Pubsplash keeps everything it writes: settings, logs, crash dumps,
//! caches, sound packs and the update staging area.
//!
//! On Windows there are two layouts, decided once per process from the folder
//! the running executable sits in. On macOS there is one — see below.
//!
//! - **Portable** — a copy unpacked from the release ZIP, which the ZIP's
//!   `portable.txt` marker identifies. Everything goes in `user_data\` beside
//!   the executable. That is what portable has to mean: the folder is the whole
//!   installation, so it can be carried on a stick, copied between machines, or
//!   deleted without leaving anything behind. A copy that scatters its settings
//!   through `%LOCALAPPDATA%` is an installed app you have to unpack yourself.
//! - **Everything else** — an NSIS install or a source build:
//!   `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pubsplash`, as it has always been. An installed copy must
//!   not write beside its executable, because a per-machine install lives in
//!   Program Files, which an unelevated Pubsplash cannot write to.
//!
//! **macOS has only the second of those**, `~/Library/Application Support/pubsplash`,
//! and that is a decision rather than an omission. Portable exists on Windows
//! because a Windows install is a folder of loose files that someone may want to
//! carry on a stick; a Mac application already *is* a single self-contained
//! object, one that the user drags where they like and that the system may
//! relocate, translocate or run read-only from a quarantined mount. Writing
//! settings inside the bundle is a thing macOS actively works against. So
//! [`is_portable`] is always false there, the migration below never runs, and
//! `update::install_kind` — which reads the same marker to decide whether a copy
//! may overwrite its own folder — does not exist on macOS at all.
//!
//! Resolved from `current_exe`, never the working directory, which a shortcut's
//! "Start in" can point anywhere — the same rule [`crate::update::install_kind`],
//! `find_doc` and `vst::scan::helper_path` follow. Resolved once and cached,
//! because the answer cannot change while the process runs and every write path
//! in the app asks for it.
//!
//! This module is `#[path]`-included into the standalone soundpack binaries,
//! which have no `crate::config`, so it depends on nothing but `std`, `dirs` and
//! `log` — the same reason `audio/convert.rs` depends on nothing but `hound`.
