//! The progress dialog shown while plugins are being scanned.
//!
//! This is deliberately a plain `Dialog` and not a `wxProgressDialog`. On MSW
//! the latter is a native task dialog living on its own thread, and everything
//! about that fought this app:
//!
//! - Its constructor spins `while (wxEventLoop::GetActive()->Dispatch())` until
//!   that thread reports a window. With `wxPD_CAN_SKIP` the window never
//!   arrives at all on this wx build, so the constructor never returns — no
//!   dialog, and a scan that looks frozen while the worker runs on invisibly.
//!   Verified in isolation: `can_abort` and `smooth` build, `can_skip` hangs.
//! - `Update`/`Pulse` yield for every event category but user input, so every
//!   call re-entered the pump timers from inside a `RefCell` borrow.
//! - Its range is fixed at construction, and replacing it to change the range
//!   deadlocks: dropping one only appends to `wxPendingDelete`, processed at
//!   idle, and the replacement's spin loop never idles.
//!
//! This dialog is **modeless** and does nothing on its own: the pump writes to
//! it, and Cancel and Skip set the worker's atomics from their click handlers.
//! No nested event loop is involved at any point, which is what makes the whole
//! class of problem above go away. Nothing here may grow a modal dialog or a
//! `Yield` for the same reason.
