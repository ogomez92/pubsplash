//! The sound-pack preview dialog, opened from the Preferences "Sound packs"
//! tab.
//!
//! It lists every sound event Pubsplash supports and plays the active pack's
//! sound for whichever one is selected. The list is built from
//! `soundpack::SoundKind::ALL` — the same registry `decode_all`, `compile` and
//! `parse_filename` iterate — so a sound event added there appears here with no
//! further work.
//!
//! Playback goes through `audio::cue`, which is local-only: a preview never
//! reaches the mixer, the stream, or a recording.
