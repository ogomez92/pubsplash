//! F6 / SHIFT+F6 pane cycling in the main window.
//!
//! Each tab is one long Tab-order chain, so reaching the Scenes list from the
//! mixer — or the tab bar from anywhere — costs a lot of Tab presses. F6 makes
//! the lists (and the tab bar) the coarse stops that every other accessible
//! Windows app offers: **F6** moves to the next list on the current tab and
//! wraps past the last one onto the tab bar, **SHIFT+F6** goes the other way.
//!
//! The target is computed from where focus *actually is*, not from a remembered
//! ring position: standing on a mixer slider that sits between two lists, F6
//! goes forward to the list after it rather than back to the first one. That is
//! why the Windows `page_order` walks the real Tab order of the page rather than
//! consulting a table — a control we know nothing about still has a position
//! relative to the lists.
//!
//! The key itself is caught by the app-wide hook in [`super::help`] (one hook
//! for the whole process) and handed here through [`request`]; [`pump`] does the
//! work on the UI thread, from the idle pump.
//!
//! ## macOS
//!
//! **Not ported, and deliberately not ported as-is.** The premise above is a
//! Windows premise: that the interface is one long Tab chain and F6 is the
//! coarse jump through it. On macOS that premise does not hold. Full-keyboard
//! Tab navigation is off by default (`AppleKeyboardUIMode` is 2, where Tab
//! reaches only text fields and lists), and the navigation model a VoiceOver
//! user actually uses is the VO cursor, which already moves freely and reads
//! the interface without needing coarse stops carved into a chain.
//!
//! So a Tab-order walk is the wrong shape here even where it would compile. The
//! ring rule in [`target`] is portable and stays, tests and all, because
//! whatever macOS ends up doing will still be "step to the next list, wrap onto
//! the tab bar". What has to be designed — with a VoiceOver user, not from
//! documentation — is what the coarse stops should be when there is no chain to
//! be coarse about, and which key should reach them. That decision belongs to
//! the accessibility phase.
// Items below are reached only from the Windows `imp` in this file (or from the
// subsystem it belongs to). They are not dead in the codebase, only unreached
// while the macOS side of this seam is unbuilt, and each will be wanted again
// the moment it is -- so this is scoped to the file rather than being a
// crate-wide allow, and comes off with the last stub here.
