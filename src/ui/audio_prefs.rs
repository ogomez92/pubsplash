//! The "Audio" tab in Preferences: which device Pubsplash plays out of.
//!
//! One setting, but it reaches two independent output paths — the mixer's
//! monitoring tap (`audio::monitor`) and local sound cues (`audio::render`) —
//! and it is half of the rule that keeps Pubsplash's own audio out of a Desktop
//! Audio source. See `audio::device::effective_output_device_id` for the whole
//! of that rule; the short version is that a Desktop Audio source pinned to one
//! endpoint captures *everything* on it, so it may never be pinned to the
//! device chosen here.
//!
//! Saves as the user changes the control, like every other tab: the dialog has
//! no OK button, only Close.
