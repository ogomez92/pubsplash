//! Keeps wxWidgets' MSAA layer out of the way of the native controls that have
//! MSAA children of their own — list boxes and radio boxes — so a screen reader
//! sees the plain Win32 control instead of a hybrid of two objects.
//!
//! wx wraps *every* MSW control: `wxWindowMSW`'s `WM_GETOBJECT` handler calls
//! `GetOrCreateAccessible()`, which creates a `wxWindowAccessible` when the
//! window has none, and hands OLEACC that instead of the control's own object.
//! What that object answers is final; what it declines (`wxACC_NOT_IMPLEMENTED`)
//! is forwarded to a **second, unrelated** object built by
//! `CreateStdAccessibleObject` — the real `LISTBOX` proxy, whose child ids index
//! list *items*, where wx's index child *windows*.
//!
//! For a control with no children that hybrid is harmless, which is why sliders,
//! checkboxes and buttons are fine. For a list it is not: the focus event the
//! reader receives comes from the native control and names a row in the std
//! object's id space, while `AccessibleObjectFromEvent` hands back wx's. The
//! reader reconciles the row across both graphs and announces it twice — once on
//! every tab or F6 into a list, though not when arrowing within one.
//!
//! Two more symptoms of the same wrapping, for the record: wx answers the list's
//! name with `wxWindow::GetName()`, which is the literal string `"listBox"`, and
//! its child count with the number of child windows, which is zero. The first is
//! what stops the native "name comes from the label in front of it" behaviour
//! from ever running, and so is the reason [`super::set_accessible_name`] had to
//! exist for lists at all.
//!
//! The fix is to answer `WM_GETOBJECT` before wx can. A subclass proc runs ahead
//! of the window's own proc, so returning `DefWindowProc` for `OBJID_CLIENT`
//! gives OLEACC the native object and wx never sees the message. The list is
//! then an ordinary Win32 list box in every respect, including taking its
//! accessible name from the static text created just before it.
//!
//! Radio boxes have the same disease, one control down. `wxRadioBox` is a
//! `wxStaticBox` (a `BUTTON` with `BS_GROUPBOX`) whose items are real
//! `wxRadioButton` **windows**, so wx wraps every one of them too, and
//! `wxWindowAccessible::GetName` answers with `wxWindow::GetName()` for
//! anything that is not a `wxButton` — the literal `"radioButton"` for each
//! item and `"radioBox"` for the group. It is non-empty, so it is returned as
//! the name and the real one (the button's window text) is never reached; role
//! and checked state still come from the std object, which is why the result is
//! a nameless radio button rather than a silent one. [`install_radio_box`] is
//! the fix, and [`super::set_accessible_name`] cannot be: it would replace the
//! accessible of the group window only, and the items are separate child
//! windows that wxdragon hands out no handles for.
//!
//! Date and time pickers are **not** a case for this module, which is worth
//! recording because it looks like one. A `SysDateTimePick32` seems certain to
//! expose its fields as MSAA children, and it does not: measured against the
//! real control, its only children are the optional none-checkbox and the
//! drop-down button, and `accFocus` answers `CHILDID_SELF` no matter which field
//! the caret is on. There is nothing for a passthrough to reveal, so pickers keep
//! [`super::set_accessible_name`] like any other childless control, and
//! [`super::picker_acc`] announces their fields itself. That module's header has
//! the measurements.
//!
//! Threading: `install` and the subclass procs all run on the UI thread. They
//! hold no state, so nothing needs uninstalling — the subclass dies with the
//! window, which matters for the lists that live in dialogs.
