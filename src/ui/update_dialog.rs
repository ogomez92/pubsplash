//! The progress dialog shown while an update downloads.
//!
//! Built on exactly the same terms as [`super::scan_dialog`], and for the same
//! reasons — read that file's header for the full account of why
//! `wxProgressDialog` is not an option on MSW. The short version: it is a native
//! task dialog on its own thread whose `Update` yields into every pump timer,
//! and whose constructor can spin forever without ever showing a window.
//!
//! So this is a plain **modeless** `Dialog` that does nothing on its own. The
//! pump writes to it; Cancel sets the worker's atomic from its own click
//! handler and needs no borrow of anything. No nested event loop exists
//! anywhere in it, and nothing here may grow one.
//!
//! The status line is a read-only `TextCtrl` rather than a `StaticText` so it is
//! somewhere to tab to and read on demand. Rewriting it announces nothing by
//! itself, which is what keeps a ten-megabyte download from reading a new number
//! aloud every second — the same rule the scan dialog follows, and the reason
//! `http::PROGRESS_INTERVAL` throttles the worker to one report a second in the
//! first place.
