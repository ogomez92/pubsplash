//! Context-sensitive help: pressing **F1** on any control speaks a
//! hand-authored help string through the user's running screen reader.
//!
//! Three moving parts:
//!
//! 1. [`tag`] is called next to each control as it is built, stamping a stable
//!    help-id onto the control's native window. On Windows that is `SetPropW`,
//!    and the property dies with the window automatically, so rebuilt panels
//!    (the mixer) never leave stale ids behind — a property this file leans on
//!    rather than merely enjoys, which is why a side map keyed by window handle
//!    is the wrong shape for it.
//! 2. The authored messages live in `help.toml` at the repo root, embedded with
//!    `include_str!` and parsed once into an id -> message map. The dev binary
//!    `gen-help` round-trips that file from the `tag` call sites (see
//!    `src/bin/gen_help.rs`).
//! 3. A global keyboard hook (mirroring the F6 hook in `fx_editor`) catches F1
//!    app-wide, swallows it, and flags the pump. [`pump`] resolves the focused
//!    window to its id and announces the message through the screen reader — on
//!    Windows a UIA notification raised on the main frame's host provider, so
//!    NVDA and Narrator speak it, interrupting whatever they were saying.
//!
//! The authored content — `help.toml`, the parse, the interning — is portable
//! and stays here. Everything that stamps, hooks or speaks lives in `imp`, and
//! **none of it is built on macOS yet**; see the macOS `imp` for what each of
//! the three needs.
//!
//! The same hook also catches F6/SHIFT+F6 for [`super::panes`] and every user
//! keybinding for [`super::keybinds`], since it is the one hook installed for
//! the whole life of the app. The F6 arm fires only while
//! the *main frame itself* is foreground, so it can never collide with the
//! editor-local F6 in `fx_editor` (whose gate is a plugin editor frame being
//! foreground) or fire under a modal dialog.
//!
//! Threading: `tag`, `install_*`, `uninstall_*`, and `pump` all run on the UI
//! thread (thread-locals below live there); only the hook proc runs in the OS
//! hook context, and it touches nothing but atomics.
