//! The UI half of automatic updates: asking, showing progress, and handing over
//! to the helper.
//!
//! The worker side is `src/update/`; this drains what it sends, from the pump.
//!
//! **These dialogs are modals on purpose.** The rule the connection and speech
//! notices follow — report in the log and the Home tab, because they arrive
//! unbidden and can land mid-broadcast — does not apply to an update, and the
//! test in `CLAUDE.md` is why. A startup check is unbidden but only ever speaks
//! when it has a question that needs answering, and the whole feature is a
//! question: nothing downloads, and nothing is replaced, without the user
//! saying so. A manual check answers a button press. Both are things the user is
//! sitting in front of.
//!
//! What *is* observed is the broadcast: [`is_a_bad_moment`] refuses to interrupt
//! a live stream or a recording. An update prompt during a show is exactly the
//! modal nobody can afford, and the check is cheap to repeat next launch.
