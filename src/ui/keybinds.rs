//! Runtime half of user-configurable shortcuts: catching the keys and running
//! the actions. The data model is [`crate::keybind`], the settings UI is
//! [`super::keybinds_ui`].
//!
//! ## Why the low-level hook
//!
//! There is no wx accelerator table in this app, and adding one would not help:
//! an accelerator only fires while our window has focus, and a control that
//! wants raw keys (the chat input, a mixer slider) eats them first. Worse, a
//! **global** binding is not something wx can express at all.
//!
//! So both capture and dispatch ride the app-wide `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook that
//! [`super::help`] already installs for F1 — that file is explicit that it is
//! "the one hook installed for the whole life of the app", and it already hosts
//! the F6 arm for [`super::panes`]. `help::keyboard_hook` calls into here in a
//! fixed order: capture first (while the Add-binding dialog's shortcut box has
//! focus, keys belong to it and nothing else), then F1, then F6, then dispatch.
//! F1 and F6 are consequently refused as bindings by the dialog rather than
//! being accepted and then silently shadowed.
//!
//! Riding the hook is also what makes the capture box work at all: ESC, ENTER,
//! TAB, the arrows and CTRL+letter are all swallowed by `::IsDialogMessage`
//! during wx's message *pre-processing*, before any handler on the control can
//! see them (`ui/slider_uia.rs` documents this at length). The hook runs ahead
//! of all of that.
//!
//! ## Threading
//!
//! The hook proc must touch nothing but atomics and its own mutexes — it runs in
//! the OS hook context and any `RefCell` borrow of `App` live elsewhere at that
//! moment would panic. So the hook matches against a flat [`SNAPSHOT`] refreshed
//! by [`reload`] on every keybinds edit, parks the matched action in [`PENDING`],
//! rings the idle doorbell, and returns; [`pump`] does the real work on the UI
//! thread from the 100 ms pump. Same shape as `panes.rs`.
