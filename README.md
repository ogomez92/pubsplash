# Pubsplash

Pubsplash is an accessibility-first Windows app for streaming audio to [Audiopub](https://audiopub.site/) or a direct Icecast server.

It is built in Rust with the wxDragon UI toolkit, and designed from the ground up to work well with screen readers such as NVDA and JAWS.

## Features

- Stream live audio to audiopub.site, a self-hosted Audiopub instance, or a direct Icecast server
- MP3 encoding with configurable bitrate
- Scenes: group any number of audio sources and switch between them
- Source types: microphone, desktop audio, per-application audio, text-to-speech, sound events, and a media player
- Applications are picked from a list of what is running by default; just the ones that have actually played sound
- Sources name themself based on what they're capturing
- Sources reconnect on their own if their device is unplugged, resets, or is not ready yet when Pubsplash starts. A source that is retrying reads "(reconnecting)" on its mixer strip
- Audiopub chat: read incoming messages in an accessible list, send outbound messages, and have chat read aloud automatically with text-to-speech (optionally spoken into the stream as well)
- The chat feed looks after itself: if the connection drops or goes quiet it reconnects on its own, and **Reconnect chat** (`ALT+O`) forces a fresh connection at any time. Neither interrupts your audio
- Nine speech engines: SAPI 5 and Microsoft Edge need no setup, and Google Translate, OpenAI, ElevenLabs, Azure, AWS Polly, Google Cloud, and a self-hosted Star server are available once you enter their credentials on the Speech tab of Preferences. Keys are encrypted for your Windows account
- Loop-safe by design: Desktop Audio capture excludes Pubsplash's own audio, so text-to-speech, sound cues and the media player can never echo into your stream
- A media player source shuffles a folder of your own music into the stream — MP3, M4A, AAC, FLAC, OGG, WAV and more, subfolders included — with its own volume, mute, monitor and sends like any other source
- The music gets out of your way on its own: it turns down while you talk, or while chat is being read aloud, and comes back up when you stop, by however much you choose
- Built-in startup and shutdown sounds, each able to be switched off, plus audio cues for stream events (listener changes, incoming and outgoing messages) that you can send to your listeners or keep to yourself
- A fully keyboard-accessible mixer with per-source volume and mute, plus an optional per-strip volume boost for sources that are too quiet at 100%
- Empty lists contain a placeholder item explaining what they're meant to contain, this is a workaround to an NVDA sisue that causes empty controls to not announce their type and speak a message like, "Unknown"
- Mixing buses with per-source sends, so sources can be routed through shared processing (see below)
- Load VST2 or VST3 plugins onto a bus, save your setup as an FX chain; export a chain to move it to another machine or give it to a friend
- The Home tab's stream overview list reports your stream status, quality, listener count and peak, and duration
- Mastodon announcements: link an account once in your browser, write your own templates with `{title}`, `{description}`, `{url}` and `{tod}` tokens, and have Pubsplash post when a stream starts and at an interval while it runs. Every post it makes carries `#PubsplashStreamInfo` so others can filter automated posts out
- The API tab breaks down what each speech engine has cost you this session — requests, characters, models and voices used — and reads your remaining ElevenLabs credit on request

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- An Audiopub account trusted to stream, or Icecast source credentials for a plain TCP Icecast server

## Download

These two links always point at the newest release, so they never go stale:

- [**Installer**](https://github.com/ironcross32/pubsplash/releases/latest/download/pubsplash-setup.exe) — the usual choice. Asks whether to install for just you or for everyone on the machine, and adds Pubsplash to the Start menu.
- [**Portable ZIP**](https://github.com/ironcross32/pubsplash/releases/latest/download/pubsplash-portable.zip) — unzip it anywhere and run `pubsplash.exe`. Nothing is installed and nothing is written to the registry. Handy for a USB stick or a machine you cannot install software on.

The two keep their data in different places, on purpose. The installed copy uses `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pubsplash`, away from the program itself, so an update or a move cannot disturb it. The portable copy uses a `user_data` folder inside the folder you unzipped, so the folder is the whole of it: carry it on a stick, copy it to another machine, or delete it, and nothing is left behind anywhere else. Updates leave `user_data` untouched.

One thing does not travel with a portable copy: saved passwords and API keys are encrypted for the Windows account that entered them, so on a different machine or a different user account they read as blank and have to be entered again. Everything else — scenes, sources, FX chains, preferences — comes across as it is.

Both kinds keep themselves up to date — see [Automatic updates](#automatic-updates). Every release is also on the [releases page](https://github.com/ironcross32/pubsplash/releases) under its version number, along with debug symbols.

Pubsplash is not code-signed, so Windows SmartScreen will warn you the first time you run it. Choose **More info** and then **Run anyway**.

## Automatic updates

Pubsplash checks GitHub for a newer version once each time it starts. This is controlled by **Check for updates when Pubsplash starts** (`ALT+S`) on the **General** tab of **File > Preferences** (`CTRL+,`), which is on to begin with.

The check is quiet by design: if you already have the newest version, or GitHub cannot be reached, nothing is said at all. You only hear from it when there is something to tell you. When there is a newer version, Pubsplash says which version is available and which one you are running, and asks whether you want it — **nothing is downloaded, and nothing on your computer is touched, unless you answer yes**.

**Check for updates now** (`ALT+U`) on the same tab asks immediately. Unlike the automatic check it always answers, including telling you that you are already up to date.

Saying yes opens a progress window with a percentage, a running megabyte count and a **Cancel download** button. Nothing on your computer has been changed while the download is running, so cancelling is always safe. Once the download finishes, Pubsplash checks it against the size and checksum published with the release; a download that was cut short or arrived damaged is thrown away with an explanation rather than installed.

What happens next depends on how you got Pubsplash, which it works out for itself:

- **Installed:** Pubsplash closes and the new installer runs. If you installed for everyone on the machine, Windows will ask for permission first.
- **Portable:** Pubsplash closes, replaces its own files, and starts itself again. Files of your own kept in the same folder are left alone.

If anything goes wrong partway through a portable update, it is undone and your existing version is left exactly as it was, with a message naming the file that caused the problem. You are never left with a half-updated folder.

Two things Pubsplash will not do. It will **never ask about an update while you are streaming or recording** — it notes it in the log and asks the next time you start it. And a copy running from a source build is never overwritten in place; it offers to open the download page instead.

## Getting started

1. Launch Pubsplash.
2. Open **File > Setup streaming services**, select **Audiopub** or add an **Icecast** service, enter that service's connection details, and press **Connect**. The built-in **Audiopub** service is permanent and cannot be removed or changed to Icecast.
3. Optionally open **File > Set stream info** to set the stream's title, description, streaming quality (MP3 bitrate), whether an Audiopub stream should be archived on the server, and whether to **record this stream** to a file on your computer. The title, description, archive, and record choices reset every time Pubsplash starts; the quality setting is saved and persists across sessions. To have archiving or recording pre-selected each launch, enable **Archive streams by default** or **Record streams by default** on the Archiving tab of **File > Preferences** (`CTRL+,`). Recordings are an exact copy of the streamed MP3, saved as `recording_<yyyy-mm-dd>_<HH-MM-SS>.mp3` in the recording folder set on that same tab — your Music library by default, or a `recordings` folder inside `user_data` if you are running the portable build, so recordings stay with the copy they were made from.
4. On the **Home** tab, press **Start streaming** (`ALT+S`). If you haven't set the stream info yet, the dialog opens first — press **OK** to start with what's filled in (tabbing into a text field selects its contents so you can just type over the defaults), or **Cancel** to not start streaming.
5. Press **Stop streaming** (`ALT+T`) when you're done.

**Help > Open Readme** and **Help <> View Changelog** open this document and the changelog in your default browser. Both are installed with Pubsplash and match the version you are running; if a copy is unavailable, Pubsplash opens the one on GitHub instead.

To record locally without going live, use **Start recording** (`ALT+R`) next to the streaming button; press **Stop recording** (`ALT+C`) to finish. It saves the same MP3 to your recording folder without connecting to the server. Recording and streaming can't run at the same time.

The **Stream overview** at the top of the Home tab is a list you can arrow through, one fact per row. The status row is always there and says whether you're streaming, recording, or both; listener and listener peak rows appear while you're streaming to Audiopub; and a duration row shows how long the current stream or recording has been running. The status row is also where trouble shows up rather than staying hidden: it reads "starting a recording" until the file has genuinely been created, "(reconnecting)" while a dropped connection is being restored, and "(encoder failed, not sending audio)" if the encoder stops, so it never claims a healthy broadcast you aren't actually making.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `F1` | Speak context-sensitive help for the focused control |
| `F6` / `SHIFT+F6` | Move to the next / previous list on the current tab, and past the last one to the tab bar |
| `F9` / `F10` | Start / stop streaming, start / stop recording (see [Keybinds](#keybinds); both can be changed) |
| `ALT+S` / `ALT+T` | Start / stop streaming (Home tab) |
| `ALT+R` / `ALT+C` | Start / stop recording without streaming (Home tab) |
| `ALT+W` | Switch to the selected scene (Home tab) |
| `ALT+V` | View the focused chat message in a window (Chat tab) |
| `ALT+O` | Reconnect the chat feed without interrupting the stream (Chat tab) |
| `ALT+F` | Refresh account balances (API tab) |
| `Enter` | Press the current dialog's OK button (or its Close button, in a dialog that only closes) |
| `Escape` | Close the current dialog; in the chat input box, clear the box |
| `CTRL+,` | Open Preferences |
| `CTRL+M` | Toggle monitoring for the focused mixer strip |
| `ALT+P` / `ALT+R` | Preview the voice / reset the selected engine to defaults (Text-to-Speech source dialog) |
| `ALT+I` / `ALT+K` | Import / remove a sound pack (Preferences, Sound packs tab) |
| `ALT+O` / `ALT+P` | Open the logs folder / compress the logs (Preferences, Logging & debugging tab) |
| `CTRL+Up` / `CTRL+Down` | Move the focused scene, source, bus, or plugin |
| `Delete` | Remove the focused scene, source, bus, send, or plugin |
| `CTRL+Tab` / `CTRL+Shift+Tab` | Next / previous parameter (plugin parameter dialog) |
| `F6` | Inside a plugin's own interface only: move focus back out to the toolbar |
| `Escape` | Close a plugin's interface window (from its toolbar; inside the plugin's own interface, `Escape` goes to the plugin) |
| `SHIFT+F10` / `Applications` | Open the context menu for the focused control (mixer volume sliders: volume boost, monitoring, and media player transport) |
| `ALT+G` | Open the Go to menu (stream page, data directory) |
| `CTRL+O` | Open a file and play it on your first media player (a default keybinding you can change or remove) |

In the mixer, sliders respond to arrow keys for 1% steps, `Page Up` / `Page Down` for 10% steps, and `Home` / `End` for maximum / minimum volume. `Up`, `Right`, and `Page Up` always raise the volume; `Down`, `Left`, and `Page Down` always lower it.

### Keybinds

The shortcuts above are fixed, but **Preferences > Keybinds** lets you put your own key on the things you reach for most, so you don't have to tab to the control first. Out of the box `F9` starts and stops streaming and `F10` starts and stops recording, and the first media player you add is given `CTRL+O` for **Open file**; all three are ordinary bindings you can change or delete.

The tab is a list of every action that can be bound, each row reading the action followed by its keys, or *Unassigned*. **Add binding** and **Edit binding** open the same dialog; **Remove binding** (or `Delete` on the list) takes a shortcut away, and **Reset to defaults** puts back just `F9`, `F10`, and `CTRL+O` on your first media player.

You can bind:

- starting and stopping the stream, and starting and stopping a recording
- switching to the next or previous scene — these cycle round, and do nothing at all if you only have one scene — or jumping straight to a scene by name
- monitoring master, any source, or any bus
- muting master, any source, or any bus
- playing or pausing a media player, skipping to its next track, and opening a file to play on it

In the Add binding dialog, choose a category and then an action. Actions that need to know *which* scene, source, bus or media player add a third dropdown right after the action; it disappears again if you pick an action that doesn't need one. Then tab to the **Shortcut** box and simply press the keys you want — they are read back to you. `Escape` or `Delete` clears the box, and `Tab` and `Shift+Tab` still move you on rather than being captured (which is also why they can't be bound). `F1` and `F6` are refused, since they belong to help and pane switching.

Tick **Global** to make a shortcut work anywhere in Windows, not only while Pubsplash is in front — handy for muting your microphone from inside a game. A global shortcut has to include `CTRL`, `ALT` or `SHIFT`, or be a function key; a bare letter or digit would be swallowed everywhere you type. Another application that grabs the same combination first still wins.

A source binding stores the source's name and applies it to whichever scene is live when you press it, so a shortcut for a source that isn't in the current scene tells you so and does nothing.

Starting and stopping a stream or a recording is announced through your screen reader however it was triggered — by a keybind, by the buttons, or by the server ending the stream — so a shortcut pressed from another tab, or from another application, never leaves you guessing.

### Volume boost

Mixer volume sliders normally stop at 100%, . If a source is still too quiet there (a microphone or a capture device that is simply low at the Windows level), open the slider's context menu with `SHIFT+F10`, the `Applications` key, or a right click, and choose **Enable volume boost**. The item shows a check mark while boost is on, and that slider then runs from 0% to 500%, amplifying the signal by up to five times.

### Streaming services

Use **File > Setup streaming services** to manage the services Pubsplash can connect to. Each service has a nickname that appears in the list.

The permanent **Audiopub** service points to audiopub.site. You can add other Audiopub services for self-hosted instances by entering their URL, email address, and password.

Icecast services use direct source streaming. Enter the server, port, mount point, username, and source password from your Icecast host. The username defaults to `source` if left blank. Direct Icecast streams do not provide Audiopub chat, listener counts, server archiving, or a public Audiopub stream page.

Both passwords are encrypted for your Windows account, the same way speech-engine keys are, so copying `config.json` to another machine will not carry them with it.

## Capturing an application

Add an **Application** source on the **Scenes and Sources** tab (**Add source**, then pick "Application") to stream one program's audio while leaving the rest of your system out of the mix.

The picker that opens lists the applications you can capture. Use the controls to widen the scope to include all applications; hit refresh to update the list.

**Type a name...** enters a program name by hand. This can be used to capture an application that's not running yet. When Pubsplash detects the app, it'll start capturing it automatically.

Applications that run as several processes at once — web browsers, Discord, Spotify, and anything else built on Chromium or Electron — are captured whole; you do not need to know which of their processes makes the sound. If you have two separate copies of the same program open, Pubsplash captures the one that is playing sound, and stays with that copy until you close it.

## The media player

A **Media Player** source plays a folder of your own music into the mix. Add one on the **Scenes and Sources** tab (**Add source**, then pick "Media Player") and its dialog asks for the folder.

Everything in that folder is played, subfolders included, so pointing it at a whole music library works as well as pointing it at one album. Pubsplash plays MP3, M4A, MP4, AAC, FLAC, OGG, WAV, AIFF, CAF, MKA and MP1/MP2 files; anything else in the folder — artwork, playlists, or Opus and WMA files, which Pubsplash cannot decode — is ignored rather than queued and then skipped in silence. The folder is read again every few minutes, so music you add during a session joins in without restarting anything.

**Shuffle the folder** is on by default. Shuffled means every file is played once before any of them repeats; when the folder runs out it is reshuffled, and a new round never starts with the track that just finished. Turn it off to play the folder in filename order instead, over and over.

A media player starts playing as soon as its scene is the live one, and stops when you switch to a scene it is not in — the same rule the microphones follow. Where it has got to is shown in the Sources list: "playing", "paused on", or a note that the folder has nothing playable in it.

### Talking over it

**Turn the music down while other sources are playing** is on by default. With it on, the music drops as soon as any other source in the scene makes a sound, and comes back up about a second after it stops, so you can talk over it — or let chat be read over it — without touching a fader.

**Turned-down level** is how far it drops, as a percentage of this source's own volume slider: 25% means a quarter of whatever the fader is set to, and 0% silences the music completely while anything else is playing. Your microphone, your text-to-speech and your sound events all count as something playing; other media players do not, so two of them never fight each other. A muted microphone, or one pulled down to zero, does not turn the music down either.

**Start turning down at** is how loud something has to get before it counts. It is a level in decibels, from -60 (almost anything) to -10 (only a shout), and it ships at -30 dB: the level of somebody deliberately talking, and far enough above a breath across the microphone, a fan or a knock on the desk that none of those turn your music down. Lower it if a normal sentence does not duck the music; raise it if something in the room does.

**Calibrate to my voice** sets that level for you, and is the easiest way to get it right. Press it and talk normally for five seconds — read a sentence at the volume you actually broadcast at — and Pubsplash listens to the same signal the ducking watches, then puts the level a little way underneath what it heard. It measures whatever is in your live scene right now, through its faders and mutes, so make sure the microphone you are calibrating is in that scene and unmuted. If nothing loud enough to be a voice arrives, it says so and changes nothing.

If your music stays turned down when nobody is talking, the source holding it there is one that is genuinely making noise: a **Desktop Audio** source counts, so a video playing in a background tab will duck the music for as long as it runs.

### Playing, pausing and skipping

The transport is on the media player's mixer strip. Open the strip's volume slider context menu with `SHIFT+F10`, the `Applications` key or a right click, and choose **Play** / **Pause**, **Next track** or **Open file**. All three are also bindable to shortcuts of your own — see [Keybinds](#keybinds) — which is what you want mid-broadcast, since a shortcut works from any tab.

Skipping tells you what it moved to rather than that you pressed it: "Media Player, playing" and then the name of the track now starting.

**Open file** plays one file of your choosing, wherever it is on your computer — it does not have to be in the source's folder, and nothing about it is remembered. It interrupts whatever is playing, exactly as a skip does, and when it finishes the folder carries on with the track it was going to play next. There is a button for it on the media player's mixer strip beside the mute box, and the first media player you add is given `CTRL+O` for it.

Pausing is for this session only: a media player is playing again the next time you start Pubsplash, or the next time you switch back to its scene.

### Hearing it yourself

A media player is an ordinary source in every other respect: it has a volume slider, a mute, bus sends, and its own monitor toggle (`CTRL+M` on its strip, or a keybinding). It plays to the stream by default and is not monitored, so press `CTRL+M` if you want to hear it yourself. What you monitor is exactly what your listeners get, volume and ducking included — when the music ducks for you, it has ducked for them.

If you monitor it through speakers rather than headphones, a microphone source in the same room will pick the music up and send it to the stream a second time, a beat late. That is worth knowing because the more obvious worry — a **Desktop Audio** source capturing the music and doubling it — cannot happen: Desktop Audio deliberately leaves Pubsplash's own sound out, and the media player's audio never leaves Pubsplash except through the mixer. Use headphones and none of it can happen at all.

## Buses and sends

A **bus** is a shared mixing point that sources can feed and that hosts a chain of VST effects. Every bus outputs to the master mix.

Open the **Buses** tab to create and manage buses: **Add bus**, **Rename bus**, **Remove bus**, and reorder with **Move up** / **Move down** (or `CTRL+Up` / `CTRL+Down`; `Delete` removes the focused bus). Each bus appears in the Home mixer with its own volume slider and mute button, after the sources.

To route a source into a bus, select the source on the **Scenes and Sources** tab and press **Sends...**. In that dialog you can add a send to any bus, set its level, remove sends, and toggle **Send directly to master**. Leave "Send directly to master" on for aux-style routing (the source is heard directly, and the bus adds an effect such as reverb); turn it off to route the source only through its buses (insert-style, for processing a microphone with EQ or compression, for example).

## Effects (VST plugins on buses)

Each bus and the master output can run a chain of VST2 and VST3 plugins. On the **Buses** tab, select a bus (or the pinned **Master output** row) and use the effects list below it:

- **Add plugin** inserts a scanned plugin at the end of the chain. Note that if a plugin outputs more than 2 channels, Pubsplash will not load it at this time.
- **Move plugin up** / **down** (or `CTRL+Up` / `CTRL+Down`) reorder the chain; effects are applied top to bottom.
- **Bypass** turns an effect off without removing it; **Remove plugin** (or `Delete`) takes it out.

Each row names the plugin and its format, so a plugin you have installed as both a VST2 and a VST3 can be told apart: `1. Compressor (VST3)`. A plugin that could not be loaded says whether it is missing from this machine or failed to start.

Effects process live, including while you are streaming. Turning bypass on or off, and opening a VST3 plugin's own interface, fade the effect out of and back into the signal path over 50 ms, so neither one clicks on air. Each plugin's settings are remembered between sessions.

### Adjusting plugin parameters

Two ways to control a plugin, both reachable from the effects list:

- **Edit parameters** opens a dialog that works with every plugin and is designed for screen readers. Type in the **Filter** box to narrow the parameter list, choose a parameter, and adjust its **Value** with the arrow keys (Page Up/Down for larger steps, Home/End for maximum/minimum). Press `CTRL+Tab` / `CTRL+Shift+Tab` to move to the next or previous parameter from anywhere in the dialog. The parameter's name and its formatted value are announced as you change it. Turn on **Show unnamed parameters** to reveal parameters the plugin didn't give proper names.
- **Open interface** shows the plugin's own window, for VST2 and VST3 plugins that provide one (many do not). Because a plugin's own interface can trap the keyboard, press **F6** at any time to move focus back to the window's toolbar (Parameters, Bypass, Plugin interface, Close), from which you can Tab normally or return to the plugin.

### Sharing effect chains

Use the chain library buttons under the effects list to reuse setups:

- **Save chain** stores the current chain in your library under a name.
- **Load chain** applies a saved chain to the selected bus (with a Load / Delete picker).
- **Export chain** writes the current chain to a `.pubfx` file you can copy to another machine.
- **Import chain** reads a `.pubfx` file into your library and offers to apply it.

When a chain you load or import uses plugins that aren't installed on this machine, Pubsplash lists the missing ones and lets you apply the chain with just the plugins you do have, or cancel. Chains are stored together in `fx_chains.json` in the data directory.

## VST plugins

Open **File > Preferences** (`CTRL+,`) and choose the **VST plugins** tab to tell Pubsplash where your plugins live. The folder list starts out with the standard Windows VST locations that exist on most machines ; add or remove folders as needed (`Delete` removes the focused folder).

Press **Scan for new plugins** to scan only files that haven't been scanned before, or **Rescan all plugins** to start over. A dialog reports how far the scan has got and names the plugin it is loading; its status line is read-only and stays quiet as it changes, so tab to it to check on the scan whenever you like. **Cancel scan** (or `ESCAPE`) stops at any time and keeps nothing. If a plugin is taking too long and you suspect it's not going to scan, **Skip this plugin** (or `ENTER`) abandons that one and moves on — it is recorded as unusable until the next **Rescan all plugins**. If a scan runs to completion, a cache will be written alongside Pubsplash's configuration file and these plugins will become available to use immediately.

## Chat

The **Chat** tab shows the messages from your Audiopub stream, newest last, each with how long ago it arrived. **View message** (`ALT+V`, or double-click) opens the selected message in a window you can navigate, select, and copy from. Type in the box at the bottom and press `ENTER` or **Send** to chat back; `ESCAPE` clears the box. Direct Icecast streams have no chat.

Pubsplash keeps the chat connection alive by itself. If it drops, or goes silent for longer than the server's keepalive allows, Pubsplash reconnects — your audio is never affected, because chat and audio are separate connections. The message list holds what your viewers said and nothing else: Pubsplash never puts its own status in it. Connection notices go to the [log](#logging) instead, and while the outgoing audio connection is being restored the Home tab reads "Streaming (reconnecting)".

**Reconnect chat** (`ALT+O`) forces a fresh connection immediately rather than waiting. You should rarely need it.

If chat still doesn't arrive after a successful reconnect, stopping and restarting the stream is the only fix. That is a fault on the server's side, not something Pubsplash can work around: the server can get stuck in a state where it won't deliver messages to a reconnected listener, and only a new stream clears it. Pubsplash says as much when it reconnects so you aren't left guessing.

## Text-to-speech

A **Text-to-Speech** source reads incoming chat aloud. Add one from the Sources list on the **Scenes** tab, and its dialog lets you choose the engine, the voice, and the rate, volume, and pitch.

Nine engines are available:

| Engine | Setup needed | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SAPI 5 | None | The voices already installed on Windows. The default, and the only engine that works offline. |
| Microsoft Edge | None | The Edge read-aloud voices. Needs an internet connection, but no account. |
| Google Translate | None | Free, unofficial, and rate-limited. Choose a language rather than a voice. |
| OpenAI | API key | |
| ElevenLabs | API key | |
| Azure | Subscription key and region | |
| AWS Polly | Access key ID, secret access key, and region | |
| Google Cloud | API key | |
| Star | The address of your own Star server | |

Credentials go on the **Speech** tab of **File → Preferences** (`CTRL+,`), once each, rather than on every source. They are encrypted for your Windows account, so copying `config.json` to another machine will not carry your keys with it.

That tab starts with a **Speech engine** picker, and everything after it belongs to whichever engine the picker names so tabbing to the ElevenLabs key does not take you past OpenAI, Azure, AWS and Google first. The three engines that need no setup say so. The tab reopens on the engine you were last looking at.

Engines other than SAPI 5 and Google Translate publish their voice lists over the network, so their voice pickers start out holding only **Default voice**. The lists refresh by themselves at startup and after credentials are validated, and the last successful list is kept until then. The line under the picker says how many voices are in it, or that they are still being fetched. On an engine whose voices are tied to particular models — AWS Polly is the one — that count follows the model you have chosen; on the rest, including ElevenLabs, every voice on your account is available to every model. Press **Preview voice** (`ALT+P`) to hear the current settings; this is the quickest way to find out whether a key is wrong, because it reports the reason rather than just going quiet.

Under the voice picker is a group of settings belonging to the selected engine, empty for the engines that have none. ElevenLabs' group ends with **Stream audio as it is generated**, on by default: speech starts playing as ElevenLabs produces it rather than after the whole message has been generated, which is most of the delay before a chat message is read. Uncheck it to wait for the complete clip. Eleven v3 has no streaming endpoint, so the box is unavailable there, as similarity boost and speaker boost already are.

Changing the engine reloads the voice list and everything else the source keeps per engine. Each engine remembers its own voice, volume, rate, pitch and settings, so moving a source to another engine and back finds the first one exactly as you left it — even across restarts, since every engine you have configured is saved in its own section of the config file. **Reset this engine to defaults** (`ALT+R`) puts the engine the picker is showing back to its factory settings and leaves every other engine alone; like everything else in the dialog it takes effect when you press OK, so Cancel undoes it.

### Hearing it, and sending it

You always hear the speech, on every engine, without having to set anything up: a Text-to-Speech source is played to you as well as mixed, so chat is read aloud from the moment you add one. Its mixer strip governs what you hear, so the source's volume and mute apply to you and to your listeners alike, and you do not need to monitor the strip (`CTRL+M` on it changes nothing, and does not double the speech).

**Send speech to the stream** controls whether your listeners hear it, and nothing else. With it unchecked, the speech reaches neither the stream nor any bus the source sends to — it is yours alone.

### Cost and flood control

The Speech tab has two limits that apply to every network engine. **Longest message to speak** cuts over-long chat messages short rather than skipping them, so one wall of text cannot tie up the engine. **Shortest gap between requests** spreads out a burst of chat so a busy stream does not run up a bill or trip a rate limit. When messages still arrive faster than they can be spoken, the oldest queued ones are dropped, so what you hear stays current.

If an engine fails (a wrong key, no network, a service outage) the reason is written to the [log](#logging) rather than shown in a dialog box, and repeats of the same failure are held down to one a minute. The symptom you notice is that the message is not spoken; the log says why. **Go to > Go to Pubsplash data directory** takes you to it.

### Checking what you have spent

The **API** tab, last on the tab bar, keeps a running tally of what each speech engine has been asked to do since Pubsplash started. Only engines that have actually spoken appear, and the most recently used one is at the top. Each engine's name is followed by its indented figures:

| Row | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Requests sent | Utterances handed to the engine, successful or not |
| Characters sent | Characters submitted, counted after **Longest message to speak** has trimmed them — the figure a per-character biller charges for |
| Credits spent | What this session cost in the provider's own unit |
| Remaining balance | What is left on your account, once fetched |
| Models used | Every model this engine has been asked for |
| Voices used | Every voice this engine has spoken in |
| Failures | How many of those requests failed |

**Refresh balances** (`ALT+F`) asks each provider for your remaining credit. Only ElevenLabs publishes one that Pubsplash can read with the key you have already given it — Azure, Google Cloud and AWS keep theirs behind separate cloud-billing APIs, and Microsoft Edge, Google Translate, Star and SAPI 5 have no account at all. Anything a provider does not report reads as "unavailable" rather than as a zero, so an empty balance is never mistaken for an exhausted one.

Nothing here is fetched unless you press the button, and none of it is kept between sessions: the tab starts empty on every launch.

## Mastodon

Pubsplash can announce your stream on Mastodon. Open **File → Preferences** (`CTRL+,`) and choose the **Mastodon** tab.

Under **Account**, type your server — just the host name, such as `mastodon.social` — and press **Authorize**. Your browser opens at that server so you can sign in and approve Pubsplash, and the authorization comes straight back to the app; there is nothing to copy or paste. **Unlink** removes it and asks the server to cancel it, and can be used at any time. Both the authorization and the app's own secret are encrypted for your Windows account, exactly as your speech credentials are, and neither ever appears in the log file. If the address is not a Mastodon server, Pubsplash says so before your browser opens rather than after — and Mastodon-compatible servers such as Pleroma, Akkoma, GoToSocial and Firefish work here too.

Under **Announcements**, "Post to Mastodon when I start a new stream" and "Make periodic still-streaming Mastodon posts" set how the matching boxes in the **Set stream info** dialog start out. Checking the second one makes the interval dropdown next to it available: every hour, every one-and-a-half hours, every two, two-and-a-half, three, or five hours, counted from the moment the stream goes live. The **Set stream info** dialog now has a **Mastodon** group of its own with the same two boxes, so you can turn either off for one stream without changing your defaults. They are unavailable until an account is linked.

### Templates

Under **Templates** you write the announcements themselves. **Add** and **Edit** open a dialog with the announcement type — start of stream, or stream continuation — and the text. Put a token in curly braces wherever you want a real value:

| Token | Becomes |
| --- | --- |
| `{title}` | The title of the stream |
| `{description}` | The description of the stream |
| `{url}` | The web address listeners use to tune in |
| `{tod}` | The time of day where you are: morning, afternoon, evening, or night |

The **Help** button in that dialog lists them all in a box you can select and copy from. Braces have no other meaning, so a stray one is an error. If you misspell a token or leave a brace unclosed, choosing **OK** tells you which one is wrong and puts you back in the dialog with your text still there.

The list shows the type, a colon, and the text, with all the start-of-stream templates first. Keep as many of each type as you like — when Pubsplash needs one it picks at random from that type, so repeat announcements do not all read the same. **Remove** (or `Delete` in the list) deletes the highlighted one; deleting all of them is safe, because Pubsplash falls back on wording of its own.

### What Pubsplash will and will not post

- **Every post ends with `#PubsplashStreamInfo`**, whether or not you type it, and this cannot be turned off. It is there so anyone who would rather not see automated posts can filter them out of their timeline.
- Nothing is posted unless you are actually streaming. A start-of-stream post waits until the stream is fully up, so the link in it always works.
- Stopping and restarting with the same title within a minute posts nothing — that is a reconnect, not a new broadcast. After longer than a minute, Pubsplash asks whether you would like to post about resuming and offers a one-off message, pre-filled and selected so you can type straight over it. Answering **No**, or cancelling, posts nothing.
- Pubsplash will not post twice within thirty seconds under any circumstances. That limit is fixed.

Whether a post succeeded or failed is recorded in the [log](#logging), the same way speech failures are, rather than in a dialog box that would interrupt your broadcast.

## The Go to menu

The **Go to** menu (`ALT+G`) has two items.

**Go to stream page** (`S`) opens the page your listeners see for the stream you are broadcasting, in your default browser. If there is no such page it tells you why instead of doing nothing: you are not streaming, the stream is still connecting or shutting down, or you are streaming straight to an Icecast server, which has no Audio Pub page.

**Go to Pubsplash data directory** (`D`) opens the folder described under [Configuration](#configuration) in File Explorer. That is where `config.json`, the logs, and any crash dumps are, so it is the item to reach for when a bug report asks for a log.

## Configuration

Pubsplash stores its configuration data in `C:\Users\<Your-user-name>\AppData\Local\pubsplash`, or, if you are running the portable build, in the `user_data` folder beside `pubsplash.exe`. **Go to > Go to Pubsplash data directory** opens whichever it is for you, so you never have to know which.

**config.json** is where all of your app settings live. It holds things like preferences, your streaming service profiles, your scenes and sources, and so on. It is written when the app is first launched. Pubsplash will also regenerate it if it becomes missing or if it is found to be corrupt. In the latter case, the corrupted file will be renamed and given a .bak extension, allowing you to fix it if you so choose.

**vst_plugins.json** stores the plugin cache. It is written when a scan runs to completion. Pubsplash uses this to determine which plugins to offer when you go to add one to a bus.

**fx_chains.json** stores the FX chains you create. You can export one chain at a time or import chains and they will be added to this file.

## Logging

Logs are written to the `logs` folder inside the data directory described under [Configuration](#configuration). The current one is `pubsplash_rCURRENT.log`; it rolls over at 5 MB and the last five are kept.

Everything to do with logging is on the **Logging & debugging** tab of **File > Preferences** (`CTRL+,`), which is the last tab:

- **How much detail to record** sets the log level. Levels, from least to most: `off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`. It ships on `info`; `debug` and `trace` are for when you are chasing a problem, and `trace` writes constantly while audio is running, so put it back afterwards. The change takes effect immediately and is remembered. Setting an environment variable such as `PUBSPLASH_LOG_TRACE=1` forces the level for that run and overrides the setting — the picker is disabled and says so when one is set.
- **Open logs folder** (`ALT+O`) opens the folder above in Explorer.
- **Compress logs** (`ALT+P`) is the one to use when reporting a problem. It packages every log file and every crash dump into a single ZIP and asks where to save it. Logging is stopped for the moment that takes, so the session you are in right now is closed off and goes into the archive complete rather than with its last lines still unwritten; it resumes as soon as the archive is written. The ZIP holds nothing else — no settings, no passwords, no API keys.

Pubsplash runs VST plugins inside its own process, so a badly behaved plugin can bring the whole app down without any warning it could otherwise print. If that happens, the last lines of the log name the plugin file that faulted, and a crash dump is written to the `crashes` folder in the data directory. Both are worth attaching to a bug report, and **Compress logs** collects both for you; the dump is only useful in a debugger and can be deleted freely.

## Building from source

Prerequisites: Rust (stable), Visual Studio 2019+ with the Windows SDK, CMake, and Ninja. Then:

```
cargo build --release
```

The first build downloads prebuilt wxWidgets libraries automatically.

## Sound packs

A Sound Events source plays cues into its scene from the sound pack chosen on the **Sound packs** tab in Preferences. It can react to listener increases, listener decreases, listener-peak increases, incoming chat, and successfully sent chat messages; each of those five has its own checkbox in the source's edit dialog, and there is nothing else to set up. A stream begins with a silent listener baseline, so connecting does not play a count-change cue.

To use a pack of your own, open **File > Preferences** (`CTRL+,`) and go to the **Sound packs** tab. **Import pack** (`ALT+I`) asks for a compiled `.pspack` file and copies it into Pubsplash's own folder, so you can move or delete the file you imported from afterwards. Imported packs are listed in the **Sound pack** combo box alongside **Built-in default**; the one you choose there is used by everything; the startup and shut-down cues and every Sound Events source in every scene. Arrowing through the list is free: the pack you land on is loaded a moment after you stop, or immediately if you tab out of the list. A pack's sounds are all held in memory while it is the chosen one, so cues play without touching the disk, and they are released as soon as you change packs. **Remove pack** (`ALT+K`) deletes Pubsplash's copy of the chosen pack after asking you to confirm, and returns you to the built-in one.

A Sound Events source's cues always play on your default Windows output device, so you hear them whatever else is going on. By default they also go out to your listeners; clear **Send these sounds to the stream** in the edit dialog to keep them to yourself, and they then never reach the stream mix or a recording. The copy you hear bypasses the mixer, so the source's volume slider only affects what your listeners hear; muting the source silences the cues everywhere.

Pubsplash includes a default sound pack . Its startup and shutdown cues play locally on the default Windows output device; they do not enter the stream mix or local recordings. Either can be turned off under **File > Preferences** (`CTRL+,`) on the **Sound packs** tab, in the **Interface sounds** group.

Open **Tools > Sound Pack Manager** to create or edit a sound pack project. Project editing, saving, and compiling controls stay disabled until you create a project with **New** or load one with **Open**. **New** asks for a pack name and parent folder, then creates a child project folder. Interface packs currently support `ui_startup` and `ui_shutdown`; stream packs support `se_listener_increase`, `se_listener_decrease`, `se_listener_peak_increase`, `se_incoming_chat`, and `se_outgoing_chat`.

Development projects contain `sound-pack.toml` plus a `sounds/` directory. WAV files must be readable by Pubsplash; mono files are duplicated to stereo and non-48 kHz files are resampled during playback. In the manager, choose one Source WAV per sound or event, use **Test** to preview it, then press **Save**. Save copies the selected WAVs into the project; it does not move or delete your original files. The saved files use names such as `se_incoming_chat_01.wav`.

Compiling creates a distributable `.pspack` from the last saved project contents and bumps the project revision after a successful build. Press **Save** before **Compile** after changing Source WAV paths. There is also a command-line compiler installed next to `pubsplash.exe`: `soundpack.exe <project-directory> <output.pspack>`. `.pspack` encrypts assets at rest and authenticates their contents. Because Pubsplash must decrypt audio to play it, it is a deterrent against casual extraction rather than DRM.
